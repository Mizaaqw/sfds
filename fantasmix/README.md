A Project by Stefano Arnone, Jakob Au, Mohammed Hassan, Tyler Hooper, and Mohamed Mohamed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our goal is to create a free website with an algorithm that generates instrumental compositions
based off of inputted user settings such as genre, instruments/sounds, and songs/bands for the
public. This algorithm guesses user’s preference and creates a 2 - 3 minute song based on their
inputted settings. There are other similar current projects such as Google’s Magenta, DeepJazz,
BachBot, and more, and we aim to learn from them and create our own version. We hope to use
our fresh young minds to find a unique solution and contribute to the creation of new, computer
generated, music.

Our motivation to make this project comes from our mutual interest in music, both listening and
creating. This program will help users find new tastes in music and new songs to listen to, as
well as inspiration for creating new music. Users could take instrumentals created on the site
and develop them on their own. We see our app as a starting point for people getting into music
development. Users will be able to find their likes and dislikes in music and allow themselves to
create/ personalize music.

Road blocks include creating something unique from the many other researchers working on the
same project for years (major roadblock), creating a complex algorithm dealing with artificial
intelligence, and integrating multiple ideas into a single project. People have been working on
this for years, and a couple college freshman might not be the winning factor. Creating
something different in our own way is yet to come. We see roadblocks ahead when it comes to
the randomization, so very much research will have to be done. Also, when it comes to finding
and storing the music files, we will have to figure out how we will implement them into the
program/site.

Our order of major tasks is to create a spreadsheet of already made algorithms, to conduct
individual research, to create our version of the music generating algorithm, and finally to design
and implement the user friendly website. Researching algorithms will definitely take some time,
as we have to figure out how the main feature of the program can be put into code. We will also
have to do some research on databasing many music files and linking them to our
corresponding website/program.

Through this process, we envision ending up with a final website that houses the program we
are creating. Ideally the app will be integrated into the website, including most of the features we
are outlining to create. Our first major milestone will be to have one working genre of music
implemented, including instruments and melodies that can be combined and exported into a file
that users can download. Upon reaching this goal, we will work on adding more to the project.
